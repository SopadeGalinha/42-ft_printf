The ft_printf project aims to provide a simplified version of the printf function in C.
It allows you to format and print to the standard output according to specified format specifiers. 
This implementation supports a subset of the format specifiers provided by the standard printf function.
Support for basic format specifiers like %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %p, %x, %X

## Getting Started

To get started with **ft_printf**, you can simply download or clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/SopadeGalinha/42-ft_printf.git`

The repository contains the source code, along with a Makefile that can be used to compile the program.

To build the program, simply run the following command in the repository's root directory:

Mandatory : `make`

This will generate the **ft_libftprintf.a** file, which can be linked to your C project.

## How to use it

To compile your code you can do:

`gcc yourmaincode.c libftprintf.a`
